Instructions on how to set up a dedicated OSX keychain for api tokens:

This work requires the keyring python module:
https://pypi.org/project/keyring/

1.  Start the GUI program "Keychain Access"

2.  From the File menu select New Keychain.

3.  Name the Keychain using the Save As: field

4.  Click the Create button.

5.  The default location of the new Keychain is

    /Users/<your_username>/Library/Keychains/<name_you_used_in_save_as_field>.keychain-db

6.  On OSX, the keychain python module uses the OS Environment Variable "KEYCHAIN_PATH" to know which Keychain to use.

    A.  You can manually set the Environment Variable using the following command:

            export KEYCHAIN_PATH="/Users/<your_username>/Library/Keychains/<name_you_used_in_save_as_field>.keychain-db"

    B.  You can automatically set the variable by adding the same command to your .bash_profile located in your home directory

7.  Initialize the "orgs" item in the Keychain using the following command (assuming you are in the same directory as "api_tokens.py")
    Note: you will be prompted for the password to the Keychain anytime you access the Keychain and it is locked. 
        (Hint: you can configure the lock/timeout value via the "Keychain Access" app)
    
    python -c "import api_tokens; api_tokens.initialize_orgs()"

8.  To test if the initialization worked run the following command:
    python -c "import api_tokens; foo = api_tokens.get_api_token('orgs'); print(foo)"

    If the initialization worked you will see an empty list printed.  If the 'orgs' item already existed
        you will see the list of orgs in the Keychain.

Note:  When prompted to input the password, if the prompt mentions the specific item you are trying to access such as the item 'orgs' 
    in the command for Step 8, it has an option to "Always Allow".  Choose that option so you are not prompted for permission 
    to read this item in the future.  This will not bypass the need to unlock the Keychain, it will just make the item available 
    without having to input the Keychain password for THAT item once the Keychain has been unlocked.
